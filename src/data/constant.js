     projectname:"Prediction of Sales",
     description:"Predictive Sales Tool",

### Problem Statement
Retail stores face the constant challenge of managing their inventory efficiently. Thousands of products are sold daily, and purchasing decisions must be cost-effective to maximize profits. Misjudging demand—either by buying unwanted items or overstocking—can lead to significant financial losses, pushing retailers into debt. A robust understanding of customer demand and effective purchasing strategies are crucial for retailers to increase sales and profits.

### Project Objective
To address these challenges, we propose developing a predictive model that forecasts product sales using various influencing factors. This model aims to provide retail store owners with insights into customer demand, helping them make informed purchasing decisions, optimize inventory levels, and ultimately enhance profitability.

### Potential Impact
By predicting sales based on factors such as store location, product type, and store characteristics, the model will enable:
- Improved inventory management, reducing overstock and understock situations.
- Enhanced understanding of product demand variations across different geographical locations.
- Better decision-making for new markets and store expansions.
- Tailored purchasing strategies based on store size and type.

### Data Source
The project utilizes the Big Mart sales dataset, obtained from Kaggle. This dataset includes sales data for various products across different stores.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The data cleaning and preprocessing steps include:
1. Loading the dataset.
2. Identifying data types (numerical, categorical, etc.).
3. Removing duplicate entries.
4. Handling missing values by:
   - Replacing null values in the "Item Weight" column with the mean.
   - Imputing "Outlet Size" based on the mode of the related "Outlet Type."
5. Standardizing categorical values (e.g., "Item Fat Content").
6. Converting object types to categorical types.
7. Rounding numerical values for consistency.
8. Encoding categorical variables.
9. Identifying and handling outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
10. Normalizing non-numerical variables.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA process involves:
1. Descriptive statistics and data visualization to understand data distributions and relationships.
2. Univariate analysis to observe individual feature distributions.
3. Bivariate analysis to explore relationships between pairs of features.
4. Multivariate analysis to examine interactions among multiple features.

Key observations include:
- High correlation between "Item MRP" and "Item Outlet Sales."
- Most products fall within specific ranges for weight and visibility.
- The majority of products are low fat, and small stores dominate the dataset.

### Algorithms and Evaluation
We employed multiple algorithms to predict sales, including:
1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. LASSO Regression
5. Ridge Regression
6. Decision Tree Regression

Each algorithm was evaluated using:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared Score (R²)

### Results
After evaluating the performance of each model, the Random Forest algorithm demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting sales. The results for the Random Forest model were as follows:
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 1094.33
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 734.94
- **R-squared Score (R²):** 0.591

The Random Forest model outperformed other models due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships and interactions between features effectively.

## User Interface
The project includes a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, allowing stakeholders to interactively explore and understand the insights derived from the predictive model for optimizing inventory management. Streamlit facilitates intuitive data visualization and exploration, enhancing accessibility and usability for decision-makers.

### Conclusion
Our predictive model, particularly the Random Forest algorithm, provides valuable insights into sales patterns, enabling retailers to make data-driven decisions for inventory management. This solution aims to enhance operational efficiency, reduce financial risks, and increase profitability for retail stores.
